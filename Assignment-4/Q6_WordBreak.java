/* Question 6: Word Break
"Given a list of coin denominations and a target sum, return the number of possible ways to make change for that sum."

Plan:
1. Memoization, or Top-Down, recursive solution. "The recursive solution is used with one simple addition:
a map of partial results is initialized, and every time a recursive call is made, the map is checked
for the parameters of the call. "

Notes:
1. I've definitely seen this in class before, but I don't remember how it was solved
2.

Time: O(C * S) where C is the total number of coins, and S is the sum we're adding up to
Space: O (C * S)
Data Structure: DFS,  Memoization (Top-Down)
Time taken: 40 minutes
