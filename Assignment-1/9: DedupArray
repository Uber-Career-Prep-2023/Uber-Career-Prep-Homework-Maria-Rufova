9. Dedup Array
Given a sorted array of non-negative integers, modify the array by removing duplicates 
so each element only appears once. If arrays are static (aka, not dynamic/resizable) 
in your language of choice, the remaining elements should appear in the left-hand side of 
the array and the extra space in the right-hand side should be padded with -1s.
